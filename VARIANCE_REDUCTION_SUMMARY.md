## Empirical Results

### Success Rates (Measured and Projected)

| Bit Size | Budget | Success Rate | Status |
|----------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 30-bit   | 50K×5  | 100%         | ✓ Measured |
| 40-bit   | 50K×5  | 100%         | ✓ Measured |
| 50-bit   | 100K×10| 90-100%      | Projected |

| 256-bit  | 10M+×50+| >0%         | Exploratory |

### Key Observations

1. **Reproducibility**: ✓ Same seed → same results
2. **Consistency**: ✓ Low variance across runs
3. **Scaling**: ✓ Predictable decrease with bit size
4. **Variance Reduction**: ✓ Fewer wasted runs
5. **Budget Control**: ✓ Success scales with resources

## Technical Highlights

### Variance-Reduction Techniques

**1. RQMC Seeding**
- Randomized Quasi-Monte Carlo initialization
- Better coverage than pseudo-random
- Owen scrambling for independence

**2. Sobol/Owen Sequences**
- Low-discrepancy sampling
- Discrepancy O((log N)^d / N) vs O(N^{-1/2})
- Fills parameter space more uniformly

**3. Gaussian Lattice Guidance**
- Z[i] lattice theory application
- Epstein zeta constant weighting
- Geometric bias toward productive regions

**4. Geodesic Walk Bias**
- Golden ratio space-filling curves
- Torus embedding for starting points
- Structured exploration

### Cross-Domain Transfer

Same techniques apply to both:
- **Integer Factorization**: O(√p) maintained
- **Discrete Logarithm**: O(√n) maintained

This demonstrates the generality and robustness of variance-reduction principles.

## Security Analysis

### What This Does NOT Do

✗ Break RSA (2048+ bits still secure)  
✗ Break ECC (256-bit curves still secure)  
✗ Achieve sub-O(√p) factorization  
✗ Achieve sub-O(√n) DLP solving  
✗ Change asymptotic complexity  

### What This Does

✓ Reduce variance in Pollard's Rho  
✓ Improve success probability per unit compute  
✓ Make performance more reproducible  
✓ Better resource utilization  

### Security Implications

**For 256-bit ECC**:
- DLP still requires ~2^128 group operations
- Variance reduction doesn't change this
- Example: With 2^80 budget, success ~0% → still ~0%

**For RSA**:
- 2048-bit keys require ~2^512 operations
- Completely infeasible regardless of variance reduction

**Bottom Line**: This is a research/engineering improvement, not a cryptographic break.
