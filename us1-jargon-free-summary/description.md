# User Story: Create Jargon-Free Summary of Factorization Results

## Desired Measurable Outcome

Produce a concise summary of factorization results that avoids technical jargon, ensuring 95% of the content uses everyday language readable by a general audience, with a word count under 800 for clarity.

## Underlying Reasoning

Heavy jargon in issues reduces accessibility, making it harder for others to understand and accept the work; a simplified summary promotes broader engagement and validation.

## Artifacts Created/Modified

- Created: `summary_factorization_results.md` file in the repository's docs folder.
- Modified: None.

## Data Used to Test

- Input from existing GitHub issues and results related to factorization experiments.

## Full Verifiable Output

- Input Parameters: Source issues (e.g., list of issue URLs or IDs containing raw results); target word limit (800); readability check tool (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid score aiming for grade 8 level).
- Complete Test Output: Full text of the generated summary; readability score report; third-party verification via manual review or tool output showing jargon avoidance (e.g., list of flagged terms and replacements).
