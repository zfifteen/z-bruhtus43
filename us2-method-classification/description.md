# User Story: Classify Factorization Method as Constant Factor or Subexponential

## Desired Measurable Outcome

Determine and document whether the method is a filter on trial division (constant factor improvement, exponential time) or a new/augmented algorithm (e.g., NFS/ECM variant) with subexponential time, with classification supported by a 1-page rationale.

## Underlying Reasoning

Clear classification helps evaluate the method's novelty and interest; constant factor improvements are less compelling for large bit sizes, while subexponential ones warrant deeper investigation.

## Artifacts Created/Modified

- Created: `method_classification.md` file in the repository's analysis folder.
- Modified: None.

## Data Used to Test

- Algorithm description from existing code and issues; theoretical time complexity analysis.

## Full Verifiable Output

- Input Parameters: Algorithm pseudocode or code snippet; bit size examples (e.g., 64-bit semiprimes); time complexity formulas.
- Complete Test Output: Classification result (e.g., "Constant factor"); supporting rationale text; runtime logs for small examples showing time behavior; third-party verification via independent complexity calculation (e.g., Big-O notation proof).
