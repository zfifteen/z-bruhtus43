## Main Request
>
> **Could you please summarize your results on factorization?**  
> Your issues are starting to get quite heavy on jargon, which I don't believe is actually productive and just makes it difficult to understand. Ideally you want your work to be as easy to understand as possible, if you want others to accept it.

## Key Questions

### Do you have

1. **A filter on trial division**, thus giving a **constant factor improvement**  
   → (still exponential time, not very interesting since guaranteed to be beaten for higher bit sizes)

2. **A new factorization method or some augmentation** of an algorithm (e.g. NFS, ECM) with **subexponential time**

---

## Benchmark Requirements

> **In either case, have you run solid benchmarks?**  
> The **only benchmark that matters** here is:  
> **time to factor many semiprimes of bit length 2B**, generated by taking **two random primes of bit length B** (not correlated, so no offsets or anything).

### Recommended Starting Point

- **2B = 128 bits** (quick to factor)
- Scale up to higher bit lengths **after proving results** at this level

---

## For Novelty Claims

> Since you seem to be claiming novelty, you should **compare against state of the art**:

- **ECM**
- **Cado-NFS**

### Fair Test Conditions

- Same programming language
- Good quality implementations

> **If you can prove a legitimate time save**, even if just a **constant factor**, then you have something to **publish after cleanup**

---

## If Claiming Probabilistic Factoring

(i.e., some percentage of semiprimes is factored)

### You must report

1. **Time to register a failure** → call this **T**
2. **Percentage of semiprimes factored** at each bit length

### Comparison Required

- Compare against a **trivial probabilistic algorithm**:  
  → Cut off an existing factorization algorithm **after time T**
- Report whether your method factors **more or fewer** semiprimes than this baseline
