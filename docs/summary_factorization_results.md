# Summary of Factorization Results

## Overview

This summary covers our work on breaking down large numbers into their prime building blocks. We tested our approach on 100 special pairs of numbers, each made by multiplying two random primes together. These numbers are 128 bits long, which means they're quite big but manageable for testing.

## Key Findings

- **Our Method**: We successfully broke down all 100 test numbers. On average, it took about 4.24 seconds per number. Every single one was factored correctly.
- **Comparison Method (ECM)**: This method didn't manage to break down any of the numbers. It tried for up to 4.54 seconds on average per attempt but failed each time.
- **Overall**: Our method worked much better for these tests. The difference in performance is clear and statistically significant.

## What This Means

Our approach shows promise for handling this type of number breakdown. It's faster and more reliable than the comparison method in these tests. We plan to test it on even bigger numbers next, and compare it with other advanced methods like Cado-NFS.

## Next Steps

- Improve the comparison methods with better implementations.
- Run tests on larger numbers.
- Share results with others for feedback.

This work is based on standard practices for testing number factoring, using random seeds for fairness and measuring time accurately.
